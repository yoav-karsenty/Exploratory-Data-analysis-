# Exploratory Data analysis 
In this project, i will study a dataframe Containing hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles cars and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

I will handle the data with the next steps:

1. Exploring the data for first impression on it.
2. Traeting missing values
3. Fixing data types and enriching the data (adding columns and creating dictionaries for example).
4. Study the core parameters that could help me understand the data further.
5. Treating outliers and study the "clean" data
6. Reacing conclusions.

 # Skills demonstrated :
 1. Treating outliers in dataset
 2. Fixing data types
 3. Visualising the data using seaborn and matplotlib
